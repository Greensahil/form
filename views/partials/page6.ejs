   <h5>IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE </h5>
   <h5>REGARDING BACKGROUND REPORTS FROM THE PSP <i>Online Service</i></h5>
   
   <div style="text-align:left">
      <p>In connection with your application for employment with Short Freight Lines, INC, its employees, agents or contractors may obtain one or more reports regarding your driving, and safety inspection history
         from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)
      </p>
      <p>When the application for employment is submitted in person, if the Prospective Employer uses any information it obtains from FMCSA
         in a decision to not hire you or to make any other adverse employment decision regarding you, the Prospective Employer will provide
         you with a copy of the report upon which its decision was based and a written summary of your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting
         Act before taking any final adverse action. If any final adverse action is taken against you based upon your driving history or safety
         report, the Prospective Employer will notify you that the action has been taken and that the action was based in part or in whole on this
         report.
      </p>
      <p>When the application for employment is submitted in person, if the Prospective Employer uses any information it obtains from FMCSA
         in a decision to not hire you or to make any other adverse employment decision regarding you, the Prospective Employer will provide
         you with a copy of the report upon which its decision was based and a written summary of your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting
         Act before taking any final adverse action. If any final adverse action is taken against you based upon your driving history or safety
         report, the Prospective Employer will notify you that the action has been taken and that the action was based in part or in whole on this
         report.
      </p>
      <p>When the application for employment is submitted by mail, telephone, computer, or other similar means, if the Prospective Employer
         uses any information it obtains from FMCSA in a decision to not hire you or to make any other adverse employment decision regarding
         you, the Prospective Employer must provide you within three business days of taking adverse action oral, written or electronic
         notification: that adverse action has been taken based in whole or in part on information obtained from FMCSA; the name, address, and
         the toll free telephone number of FMCSA; that the FMCSA did not make the decision to take the adverse action and is unable to provide
         you the specific reasons why the adverse action was taken; and that you may, upon providing proper identification, request a free copy
         of the report and may dispute with the FMCSA the accuracy or completeness of any information or report. If you request a copy of a
         driver record from the Prospective Employer who procured the report, then, within 3 business days of receiving your request, together
         with proper identification, the Prospective Employer must send or provide to you a copy of your report and a summary of your rights
         under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
      </p>
      <p>Neither the Prospective Employer nor the FMCSA contractor supplying the crash and safety information has the capability to correct
         any safety data that appears to be incorrect. You may challenge the accuracy of the data by submitting a request to
         https://dataqs.fmcsa.dot.gov. If you challenge crash or inspection information reported by a State, FMCSA cannot change or correct this
         data. Your request will be forwarded by the DataQs system to the appropriate State for adjudication.
      </p>
      <p>Any crash or inspection in which you were involved will display on your PSP report. Since the PSP report does not report, or assign, or
         imply fault, it will include all Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) crashes where you were a driver or co-driver and where those crashes
         were reported to FMCSA, regardless of fault. Similarly, all inspections, with or without violations, appear on the PSP report. State
         citations associated with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR) violations that have been adjudicated by a court of law
         will also appear, and remain, on a PSP report.
      </p>
      <p>The Prospective Employer cannot obtain background reports from FMCSA without your authorization</p>
